#+title: MRS instance definitions

Each *MRS* instance is a tuple ⟨*gt*, *i*, *R*, *HC*, *IC* ⟩.
 - *gt* is the global TOP handle
 - *i* is the top INDEX
 - *R* is a bag of predications (elementary predications, or EPs, os RELS)
 - *HC* is a possibly empty bag of handle constraints (hcons, HCONS)
 - *IC* is a possibly empty bag of individual constraints (icons, ICONS)


Elementary predications have structure ⟨p, l, v, A⟩
 - *p* is a semantic predicate (also called a relation)
 - *l* is a scopal handle (called its label)
 - *v* is the intrinsic variable (distinguished variable, characteristic variable, arg0)
 - *A* is a possibly empty list of arguments

Handle constraints and individual constraints are simple triples ⟨lhs, rel, rhs⟩.

 - *HCONS*:
   - *lhs* (given by the feature hi, or harg) is a handle-valued slot (also called a hole)
   - *rel* is the relation of the constraint, which is one of qeq, lheq, or outscopes
   - *rhs* (given by the feature lo or larg) is the label (handle)


 - *ICONS*:
   - *lhs* and rhs are instance variables (e.g., intrinsic variables, not handles),
   - *rel* can be any pertinent relation defined by a grammar
